# The Osxcart Library #

Osxcart, or **OS X C**onverting **A**nd **R**eading **T**ool, is a
library designed to import file formats used in Mac OS X, NeXTSTEP, and
GnuSTEP into GTK+/GLib-based programs easily, using a lightweight
interface.
The "s" in Osxcart is silent.

Right now, the Osxcart library includes a module for reading and writing
property lists (".plist" files) in XML format, and a module for
importing and exporting RTF documents to and from GtkTextBuffers.
